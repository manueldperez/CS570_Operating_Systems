I based the start of my programs from exec1.c, fork2.c, dup2.c, and sighandler.c. Apart from that, all code was written by me.
Everything works as intended, with the exception of the multiple pipelines not being able to do the middle commands, and also hereis currently doesn't work with a pipeline.
What happens if I see echo hi> |? Currently my program proceeds to process '|' as the name of the output file.
What happens if I see sort < foo << EoF? My program will provide an error message saying that we can't have multiple input redirections.
Does p2 announce dollar-sign lookup errors? Yes it returns a null, it skips forking, and it moves on to the next line/prompt.
Temporary 'hereis' file deleted? Yes, I did make sure to delete the file.
